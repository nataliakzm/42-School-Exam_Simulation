# School 42 Exam Simulator: Rank 02
This interactive coding challenge spans across four levels of increasing difficulty. In every level, a question, randomly selected from a curated pool. 

As you ascend from one level to the next, you'll get a programming problem that tests your understanding of C programming. With each click of the `Next Level` button, you aren't merely moving to a new level, but also stepping into a new realm of complexity and learning.

After completing all four levels, continue by clicking the `Start Over` button. This will allow you to revisit the exam, solidify your knowledge, and solve more tasks. It's not just an exam preparation tool, but a companion in your quest for mastery in C programming.
